## Collaboration

This document is a collaborative effort. If you find improvements for how
agents work with Kodi, please extend this guide and send the changes back to
us.

Once dependencies are installed, configure Kodi with:

```bash
cmake -DAPP_RENDER_SYSTEM=gl -DENABLE_INTERNAL_FFMPEG=ON ..
```

## Coding guidelines

Follow these best practices when contributing to the Kodi code base:

- Keep the code easy to understand and well documented. Add comments that
  describe why the code exists and how it works. Poorly commented code will be
  rejected during review!
- New source files should begin with the standard Kodi copyright header using
  the current year:

  ```cpp
  /*
   *  Copyright (C) 2026 Team Kodi
   *  This file is part of Kodi - https://kodi.tv
   *
   *  SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later
   *  See LICENSES/README.md for more information.
   */
  ```

## Testing guidelines

Tests are part of the code base and should be just as easy to read as
production code. When writing unit tests:

- Document the intention of each test case with clear comments. A short
  paragraph or sentence explaining what behavior is being verified helps
  reviewers understand the purpose of the test.
- Comment any non-obvious setup or test data so that future contributors can
  quickly follow how the test works.
- Keep tests focused on a single behavior, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- Begin each test with a short comment summarizing what it verifies. This
  makes automated summaries clearer for reviewers.
